Final project for Lewis University's Object Oriented Design course.


The idea of the project is to showcase design patterns and their functionality in real life applications
Utilizes 4 design patterns (Command, Decorator, Template and Factory) to create a car rental app.
The car can be rented with a driver to take you places or you can rent a high end model for your self to drive with modifications.

Some things to note:

When this project was created, no package was created. Therefore I've had to keep the .Class and the JUnit test file (MainTest.java)
in the src folder.
